title: November 2018 - Stammtisch
---

On Tuesday, 13th November 2018, five people met in order to collect some data for OpenStreetMap (OSM). We used the app [StreetComplete](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/) which is very easy to use. We also exchanged our experiences with OSM. It looks like that there are actually many mappers in the Salzburg area but there is almost no personal exchange. It would be great if Maptime Salzburg could serve as a platform for this in the future.

Afterwards more people were meeting in the [Trumerei](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2949428521) bar. We discussed various geo-related topics and planned our next event which will be held in the middle of December. The presenations for the next meeting will probably be git, GDAL/OGR and PostGIS. Moreover we would like to give all participants  the possibility to introduce themselves. Additionally there shall be time for some very short lightning talks.

Just in time for this second meetup we finished our new logo. It shows the two skylines of Salzburg: the castle and the churches of the old town.

We are looking forward having more people on our next meeting. If you need more information join us on our [mailing list](https://lists.fossgis.de/mailman/listinfo/maptime-salzburg) or follow us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/maptimesalzburg).
