title: November 2018 - Stammtisch
---

On Tuesday, 13th November 2018, five people met in order to collect some data for OpenStreetMap (OSM). We used the app [StreetComplete](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/) which is very easy to use. We also exchanged our experiences with OSM. It looks like there are actually many mappers in the Salzburg area, but there is almost no personal exchange at the moment. It would be great if Maptime Salzburg could serve as a platform for this in the future.

Afterwards, more people met in the [Trumerei](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2949428521) bar. We discussed various geo-related topics and planned our next event, which will be held in the middle of December. The presentations for the next meeting will probably be git, GDAL/OGR and PostGIS. Moreover, we would like to establish the practice of giving all participants the possibility to introduce themselves at every meeting. Additionally, we are hoping there shall be time for some very short lightning talks.

Just in time for this second meetup we finished our new logo. It shows the two skylines of Salzburg: the castle and the churches of the old town.

We are looking forward to having more people at our next meeting. If you would like more information or to keep up with our activities, join our [mailing list](https://lists.fossgis.de/mailman/listinfo/maptime-salzburg) or follow us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/maptimesalzburg).
