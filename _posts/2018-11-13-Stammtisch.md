title: November Stammtisch
---

We have presentations every other month. The month in between we meet for socializing, talking and having a good time. In German language we call this "Stammtisch". However, we also try to have a little activity as well. This time we want to solve some OpenSteetMap tasks with the Android App [StreetComplete](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/).


**Date:** Tuesday, 13th October 2018


**Time:** 18:00 for OpenStreetMap mapping, 19:00 for the Stammtisch


**Location:** [Trumerei](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2949428521) Bar


If you have an Android phone, please install the app [StreetComplete](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/) and make sure you have mobile internet connection and enough battery. At 18:00 [Jakob](https://jakobmiksch.eu) will give a short introduction, afterwards we will walk around and improve the OpenStreetMap database.

Join us on our [mailing list](https://lists.fossgis.de/mailman/listinfo/maptime-salzburg). There you can ask questions and keep updated what is happing.
