The online geo quiz night in November was fun and many said: Let's do that again in December! The quiz works well in an online setting, however we think the social aspect should not be neglected.
Therefore, in December we will have a twofold-event: We start the evening with another quiz, and afterwards we will move from the traditional video conference to a more playful setting to have an online Stammtisch in [gather.town](https://gather.town/) (works in a browser)!

For the quiz, join our video conference and use a mobile device to take part in the quiz! You can submit your answers under a nickname i.e. anonymously if you want.

**date**: Wednesday, 16th December 2020

**time**: Quiz: 20:00 - 20:45, afterwards Stammtisch

**place**: Link follows

**quiz**: When the quiz starts, you will be able to submit your answers (link follows).

Again you're invited to send us suggestions for quiz questions to maptime.sbg@gmail.com. We will select maximum one question per contributor.

Looking forward to seeing you! And don't forget to get yourself some beverages and wasabi peanuts for the typical Maptime feeling!
