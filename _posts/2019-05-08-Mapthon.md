On our next Maptime event will be humanitarian Mapathon where we will map remote areas from satellite imagery. The video at the bottom explains it very well. Drinks and snacks will generously be provided by [Z_GIS](www.zgis.at). Please bring:

- a **laptop** + charging cable
- a mouse (makes mapping much easier)
- create an [OpenStreetMap account](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new), if you don't have one yet

If you do not have a laptop, you are of course welcome as well. Please let us know before and we try to organize something for you.

**date**: Wednesday, 8th May

**time**: 19:00h

**place**: [iDEAS:lab](https://ideaslab.sbg.ac.at/) (Schillerstrasse 30, Techno-Z, Building/Bauteil XV)
