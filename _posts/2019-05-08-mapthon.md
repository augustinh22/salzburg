title: May 2019 - Mapathon
---

On Wednesday the 8th of May starting at 19:00 we facilitated the first Maptime Salzburg mapathon, focusing on a humanitarian mapping task in Southern Kivu (Task #5912) in collaboration with Doctors without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)), the Austrian Red Cross and Missing Maps. Edith Rogenhofer from MSF Vienna was kind enough to introduce the area and mapping campaign via Skype, despite some technical difficulties.

We met again at the [iDEAS:lab](https://ideaslab.sbg.ac.at/) (Schillerstrasse 30, Techno-Z, Building/Bauteil XV), generously made possible by [Z_GIS](https://zgis.at/), including some sponsored snacks and beverages. Around 15 people participated.
