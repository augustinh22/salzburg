On the 13th of February we will have the next round of Maptime presentations, focusing on interactive coding and mapping using Jupyter!

We will be meeting again at the [iDEAS:lab](https://ideaslab.sbg.ac.at/), generously made possible by [Z_GIS](https://zgis.at/). Beverages and light snacks will be available on a pay-what-you-can donation basis, but feel free to bring your own, either for yourself or to share.

**date**: Wednesday, 13th February

**time**: 19:00h

**place**: [iDEAS:lab](https://ideaslab.sbg.ac.at/), Schillerstrasse 30, Techno-Z, Building/Bauteil XV

If you, or someone you know, would be interested in presenting any topic in a 5-6 minute format related to Jupyter and geographic data or maps, please get in touch! We are hoping to have a collection of shorter presentations this time around.
