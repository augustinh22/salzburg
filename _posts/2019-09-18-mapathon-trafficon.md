On the 18th of September we will have another Maptime Mapathon, this time kindly hosted by [Trafficon](https://www.trafficon.eu/).

**date**: Wednesday, 18th September 2019

**time**: 19:00 h

**place**: Trafficon Meeting Room, 7th floor, [Strubergasse 26, 5020 Salzburg](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=47.80948&mlon=13.03079#map=19/47.80948/13.03079)



This event does not require any prior skills, everyone interested is welcome! We will provide a basic introduction.

Please bring:
* a laptop,
* a mouse (for convenient mapping) and
* an [OpenStreetMap Account](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new).

If you already know the browser-based iD editor and would like to try the more advanced [JOSM editor](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/), we will also provide an introduction to that.

Afterwards we will go to the Trumerei bar.
