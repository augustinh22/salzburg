On the 26th of June we will be having an evening of grilling following a 20 minute talk by Dr. Anthony Robinson, Associate Professor at Penn State. His research focuses on cartography, geography, visual analytics and online learning and he will be talking about viral maps.

**Guest Speaker**: [Dr. Anthony Robinson](https://sites.psu.edu/arobinson/)

**Overview**: It’s now quite possible to create and share a map that is seen by thousands of people around the world with minimal effort. Maps that begin to spread rapidly via social media can be considered examples of viral cartography. In recent research, we have been working in the GeoVISTA Center at Penn State on developing new ways to analyze and understand maps in social media. In this talk I will show some of the progress we’ve made so far in analyzing and visualizing elements of design, dissemination, and disinformation related to viral maps.

**date**: Wednesday, 26th June

**time**: 18:30h talk, 19:00h grilling

**place**: [iDEAS:lab](https://ideaslab.sbg.ac.at/), Schillerstrasse 30, Techno-Z, Building/Bauteil XV [grilling outside between Campus3+4]

We will be meeting again at the [iDEAS:lab](https://ideaslab.sbg.ac.at/), generously made possible by [Z_GIS](https://zgis.at/) and heading outside to grill afterwards. Beverages and light snacks will be available on a pay-what-you-can donation basis, but feel free to bring your own snacks or items to be grilled, either for yourself or to share.
