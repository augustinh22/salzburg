In the beginning of October we had the first issue of our "Maptime Salzburg" meetup. We were generously hosted by [Trafficon](https://trafficon.eu). We had three presentations about OpenStreetMap (OSM). First Jakob gave an overview about the [OSM ecosystem](http://jakobmiksch.eu/post/openstreetmap_overview/).
Afterwards Niko talked about [data science](https://janakiev.com/osm-data-science/) with OSM. Sebastian finally compared the OSM street network with other map providers.

The evening ended in the [Trumerei](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2949428521) bar where the almost 20 participants had the chance to exchange experiences.
