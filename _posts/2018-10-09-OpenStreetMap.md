In the beginning of October we had the first issue of our "Maptime Salzburg" meetup. We were generously hosted by [Trafficon](https://trafficon.eu). We had three presentations about OpenStreetMap (OSM).

First Jakob gave an overview about the [OSM ecosystem](http://jakobmiksch.eu/post/openstreetmap_overview/). Afterwards Niko talked about [data science](https://janakiev.com/osm-data-science/) with OSM. Sebastian finally compared the OSM street network with other map providers.

The evening ended in the Trumerei bar where the almost 20 participants had the chance to exchange experiences.
