title: January 2019 🗺 Maptime Stammtisch 🌍 OSM mapping
---

Around 20 people came to the Maptime Stammtisch on Wednesday, January 16th at [Academy Bar](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4742175090). The OpenStreetMap(OSM) mapping activity beforehand with the Android app [StreetComplete](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/) had very low attendance, but the few participants had fun walking around in the cold, damp weather anyways. :-)

We are looking forward to the next round of presentations in February to discuss ways that Jupyter can be used when working with geospatial data, maps, and more.
