title: February 2021 - Talk and Stammtisch
---

In February we tried a new format in the new Maptime Work Adventure environment. We started with a talk by [Franz Gusenbauer](https://www.igutech.at) in the Work Adventure meeting room. Franz told us how he established his own geoinformatics company and explained the technical setup in his software products - powered by open source software. Thanks for this insightful talk!

Afterwards we explored the Workadventure space and had an enjoyable virtual Stammtisch. Looking forward to next time!
